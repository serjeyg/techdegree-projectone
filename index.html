        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am a 19-year-old college student who is trying to figure out what I would like to do in the field of Computer Science. Ideally, I would like to get enough experience with HTML, CSS, and JS to get myself any entry-level job, so I can get as much experience as possible. Earlier in the semester I took MySQL, and I loved it. I would like to take a more in-depth course on that language again. When I am not teaching myself how to program, I am taking pictures with my Nikon D800, but as much as I love photography, it does not seem like a promising career choice.</p>
        <p>Aside from English, I can speak Russian, and would love to learn American Sign Language.</p>
